# Project Overview – AI Retail Decision Support System

## Background
Retail businesses generate large amounts of data from sales systems,
customer interactions, and in-store activity.
However, business owners often lack the tools to convert this data into
clear and actionable decisions.

---

## Problem Statement
Most existing solutions focus on isolated analytics or predictive models.
They provide charts and numbers but fail to explain insights in a way that
supports real business decisions.

---

## Proposed Solution
This project proposes an AI-powered decision support system that integrates
multiple AI techniques into a unified framework.

The system analyzes data from different sources and presents insights using
business-oriented KPIs and a natural language chatbot interface.

---

## Key Features
- Modular AI architecture
- Business-focused performance indicators
- Explainable insights rather than raw predictions
- Unified chatbot interface for decision support

---

## Target Users
- Small and medium retail business owners
- Store managers
- Business analysts

---

## Project Scope
- Offline data analysis using historical or public datasets
- Focus on decision support rather than automation
- Emphasis on business value and explainability

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved understanding of customer behavior
- Better inventory and staffing planning
- Faster and more informed decision-making
